## Introduction

In this assignment you will prepare the necessary resources for interfacing with the class and
completing assignments.  For this assignment you will complete tutorials and achieve basic
proficiency with three main tools:

1. Git
2. Markdown
3. LaTeX

You've already started this assignment by accepting the link you
received through Github classroom!  Your next step will be to create a
branch of this assignment.  **Always create a branch as a first
step!**  Creating a branch is one of the most essential best practices
for working in a repository.  It lets you easily collaborate with
larger groups, organize your work, and work in isolation.

**Submission**: You will submit your final assignment by creating a
  new branch named "submission".  Do this by using the following
  commands:

    git branch submission
    git checkout submission
	git push origin submission

This creates a new branch from your current working branch, switches
to that branch, and then pushes the new branch to the remote
repository.

If you want to modify your solution you should execute the command
`git checkout <branchname>` to switch to your working branch named `<branchname>`, make your
changes, be sure to add, commit, and push them, then merge your
changes into the submission branch with:

    git checkout submission
    git merge <branchname>
	git push origin submission

The final date on your `submission` branch will be used as the
submission date for your assignment.

## Grokking Git

Git is a version control system used for tracking changes and coordinating work on digital files among multiple people.
Version control, or revision/source control is a way to manage changes on documents, code, or other data to allow 
concurrent editing, resolution of conflicts, and long-term management and saving of changes.  You can read more 
about why using revision control in higher education is important for your future [here](https://medium.com/@jsiarto/version-control-and-higher-education-78dc8e3f66f1#.wbogkr8rl) and [here](https://jarofgreen.co.uk/2013/05/why-programmers-should-learn-git/).

- [x] Complete the
  [Git 101 Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) -
  this should take about 15 minutes.
- [x] Review the Github
  [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)
  which will help you remember key commands and workflows with Git.
- [x] Make note of the additional resources available
  [here](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/)
  for going deeper into your learning about git and Github.

You can learn more about installing git for Windows and Mac machines [here](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)

## Mastering Markdown

Since we will be using git for all assignments in this class, it will
be important for you to learn **Markdown**.  Markdown is a lightweight
language for formatting text which is designed to be more human
readable than most markup languages, like HTML, but also to be easily
rendered in HTML, or rich text display formats.  Markdown is the
preferred language of git readme files, and is the language used to
code the file you are reading.

- [x] Read the *Mastering Markdown* guide available
  [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- [x] In your checked out homework, make sure you click the boxes for
  this assignment of completed objectives, and commit the changes to
  git!

Markdown was originally developed by John Gruber of
[Daring Fireball](daringfireball.net), he's written about markdown
[here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

- [x] Create a new directory for a markdown assignment, and create a basic
markdown file in it.  Include a short discussion of the git workflow,
with separate sections for git, and the importance of good
documentation.  Include git commands formatted as code/syntax to show
the basics of the git workflow.

## Learn LaTeX

While Markdown is great for README files, and for general
communication and notation, it really fails when it comes to
mathematics, and other important science and technology communication
related topics, like graphs and figures.  Lucky for us, there is
LaTeX.  LaTeX is a document preparation system designed to allow users
to write up scientific and mathematical results easily, quickly, and
in a format-agnostic manner which can be templated, styled, and
modified without changing the text itself.  This makes it different
from word processors like LibreOffice, MS Word, or Google Docs in
which formatting informating is explicitly set in the text.

For this last part of Homework -1, you will need to use your git
skills to check out a homework template from Github, make
modifications in LaTeX, and compile a final PDF of your assignment for
submission.

- [x] Check out the basic LaTeX template from git: https://github.com/IowaStateRozier/LaTeXHomeworkTemplate
- [x] Bookmark the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) on LaTeX, it answers any question you are
  likely to have, including very advanced ones.  Don't try and read
  the whole thing today, it's very long!
- [x] Bookmark the LaTeX
  [cheat sheet](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/latexcheat/latexcheat/latexsheet.pdf),
  it will come in handy!
- [x] Make sure you have LaTeX
  [installed](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installation) on
  your machine.  It is available for all operating systems.  Some
  people prefer to work with LaTeX
  [online](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installation#Online_solutions)
  with an editor in their browser, like
  [Overleaf](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installation#Online_solutions)
  or [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/).  I do not recommend
  this, but it is your choice.  As Computer Scientists you are better
  off learning to use a developer friendly editor like
  [Emacs](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Emacs), or
  [vi](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_Editor).

Create a directory in the repository for this homework, copy over the
template you checked out for git, and look for a comment labeled:
    % Homework Details

Below this you will find a section you can tailor for your
assignment in the form of `\newcommand` directives.  This work a bit
like a variable, `#define`, or other alias-type command.  Update their
definitions to set up your assignment.

Read the [basics](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Basics) section
of the LaTeX wikibook to learn about the commands in this homework
template.

- [x] Compile your new document as a PDF.
- [x] Commit the changed file to your repository.  Make sure to push your changes!

Lastly...

- [x] Create a pull request for your branch! (You did remember to
  build a branch didn't you?)
